It's not always easy to predict whether a bayesian sensor works as expected based on the conditions so I made a small debugger that calculates all probabilities for all possible observation states

It's a simple webpage: https://drake7707.github.io/hass-bayesian-debugger/

Just paste in your binary sensor yaml and it will list all outcomes
